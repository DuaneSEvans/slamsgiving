              On May 12th, 2011, Dan Harmon’s hit sitcom “Community” aired their
              24th episode of Season 2, titled “For a Few Paintballs More”. For
              the first time, the phrase “Denny’s is for winners” was
              broadcasted to the world.
              <br />
              <br />
              Years later, in the Summer of 2018, a group of undergraduate
              academic all-stars uncovered this phrase while watching reruns of
              Community and decided to adopt it as the mantra of their VUL
              Ultimate Frisbee Team ‘Scoober Doober Doo’. When a game was won,
              the team would go to Denny’s (usually Marine Drive Denny’s RIP) to
              celebrate the victory. They did not go often.
              <br />
              <br />
              That same summer at the tail end of a gruelling through hike of
              the Howe Sound Crest Trail (which included an 11 hour hiking day,
              pouring rain, a nearby industrial car barge fire, 10 meters of
              visibility, and an attempted waterboarding-by-tent), it was
              proposed that the completion of this hike should be deemed A Win.
              The weary hikers b-lined to the North Shore Denny’s, and boy,
              Denny’s had never tasted so good.
              <br />
              <br />
              From that day forth, Winning became a core part of their ethos and
              culture - from winning games of rec league ultimate frisbee, to
              surviving exams, outdoor adventures, and volitional hardship (aka
              Type 2 Fun) - and Denny’s, as a trusted family friendly
              establishment, was the natural venue to celebrate.
              <br />
              <br />
              On September 18th; 2020, an e-mail was received from Denny’s
              advertising their Thanksgiving Turkey Dinner Deal - $59.99 for a
              roast turkey dinner for four. This planted the seed for
              Slamsgiving, a portmanteau of “Grand Slam” (Denny’s signature
              breakfast) and “Thanksgiving”. On October 10th, 2020 at 7:45pm, a
              humble gathering of four friends in the basement of 57 W 17th Ave
              in Vancouver, BC took place. They ate their Grand Slams, listened
              to a carefully curated playlist (Songs That Slam), watched Shrek
              2, played Shrek Super Slam and generally… got Slammed.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2021, a new venue was found to accommodate more friends. In
              2022, it was relocated again to accommodate over 30 and for the
              first time the Slamsgiving meal was hosted in-person at Fancy
              Denny’s. Over the years, Slamsgiving has grown from a humble
              gathering to the slamming celebration we know and love today.
